# Marine-Biodiversity-Mapping-through-Intelligent-Image-Analysis-In-JAVA-
This is my first project repository in which i built a model to identify and classify the images of underwater marine species. I built this model in JAVA programming language in which i used maven tool to download different libraries to use. I downloaded DL4J, ND4J and SL4J to implement CNN in this project which give high accuracy and predict well.
